View and Analyze Expenses: Users can view their expenses in various formats, including lists and charts, filtered by date and category.
Manage Categories: Users can add, delete, or modify expense categories.

Main Dashboard: Shows an overview of recent spending and quick links to add expenses or view detailed reports.
Expense Log: Detailed list of past expenses sortable by various parameters.
Charts and Analytics: Visual representations of spending patterns.
Note: Detailed GUI sketches will be included as supplementary images.

4. CLI Design
The CLI will provide functionalities similar to the GUI but in a command-line environment, including:

a. Adding expenses via commands.
b. Generating reports with command options.
c. Managing expense categories through command-line arguments.
